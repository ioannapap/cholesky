# cholesky
Cholesky decomposition for the numerical solution of linear equations

IN GENERAL: 

We propose two different ways:

1. Using scipy and numpy libraries for time economy (cholesky_sp_np.py, cholesky_sp_np.ipynb files are the same just in different formats)

2. Hard-coding Cholesky methodology for computation, yet still using numpy library for initialization of the arrays.


SETUP: (Prerequisite: Python3)

Jupyter Notebook and given libraries if not installed: (Linux)

>> pip3 install --upgrade pip

>> pip3 install jupyter

>> sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy ipython ipython-notebook


HOW TO RUN: 

2. There are files in .py format that run with:

>> python3 <name.py> 

1. For this project we can use Jupyter Notebook for cholesky_sp_np.ipynb file and run it via Notebook. 

Open your terminal:

>> jupyter notebook

and then choose your .ipynb file
